DOCUMENTATION

Classes used explained: 

container : places elements within their own sector - also provides padding (research w3schools padding if needed)

row : in this case row is a bootstrap perk. It is an already coded class that creates a row (research row in getBootstrap or w3schools if needed)


While completing this - write down the questions that come to mind so we can cover them later. 


Also - put your own spin on your final product.
